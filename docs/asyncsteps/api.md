# AsyncSteps API reference

This is excerpt from [FTN12 v1.10](https://specs.futoin.org/final/preview/ftn12_async_api-1.10.html) AS IS.

## 2.1. Types

* *void execute_callback( AsyncSteps as[, previous_success_args] )*
    * first argument is always AsyncSteps object
    * other arguments come from the previous as.success() call, if any
    * returns nothing
    * behavior:
        * either set completion status through as.success() or as.error()
        * or add sub-steps through as.add() and/or as.parallel()
        * Optionally, set set time limit through as.setTimeout() and/or
            set cancel handler through as.setCancel()
        * any violation is reported as as.error( InternalError ). Not
            applicable to implicit success.
    * can use as.state() for global current job state data
* *void error_callback( AsyncSteps as, error )*
    * the first argument is always AsyncSteps object
    * the second argument comes from the previous as.error() call
    * returns nothing
    * behavior, completes through:
        * as.success() - continue execution from the next step, after return
        * as.error() - change error string
        * return - continue unwinding error handler stack
        * any violation is reported as as.error( InternalError )
    * can use as.state() for global current job state data
* *void cancel_callback( AsyncSteps as )*
    * it must be used to cancel out of AsyncSteps program flow actions, like
        waiting on connection, timer, dedicated task, etc.
* interface *ISync*
    * *void sync( AsyncSteps, execute_callback[, error_callback] )*
        * synchronized independent or parallel AsyncSteps, execute provided
            callbacks in critical section.

    
## 2.2. Functions

It is assumed that all functions in this section are part of **single AsyncSteps interface**.
However, they are grouped by semantical scope of use.

### 2.2.1. Common API - can be used in any context

1. *AsyncSteps add( execute_callback func[, error_callback onerror] )*
    * add step, executor callback gets async interface as parameter
    * can be called multiple times to add sub-steps of the same level (sequential execution)
    * steps are queued in the same execution level (sub-steps create a new level)
    * returns current level AsyncSteps object accessor
1. *AsyncSteps parallel( [error_callback onerror] )*
    * creates a step and returns specialization of AsyncSteps interface
        * all add()'ed sub-steps are executed in parallel (not strictly required)
        * the next step in current level is executed only when all parallel steps complete
        * sub-steps of parallel steps follow normal sequential semantics
        * success() does not allow any arguments - use state() to pass results
1. *Map state()*
    * returns reference to map/object, which can be populated with arbitrary state values
1. *get/set/exists/unset* wildcard accessor, which map to state() variables
    * only if supported by language/platform
1. *AsyncSteps copyFrom( AsyncSteps other )*
    * Copy steps and state variables not present in current state
    from other(model) AsyncSteps object
    * See cloning concept
1. *clone*/*copy c-tor* - implementation-defined way of cloning AsyncSteps object
1. *AsyncSteps sync(ISync obj, execute_callback func[, error_callback onerror] )*

### 2.2.2. Execution API - can be used only inside execute_callback

*Note: success() and error() can be used in error_callback as well*

1. *void success( [result_arg, ...] )*
    * successfully complete current step execution. Should be called from func()
1. DEPRECATED: *void successStep()*
    * efficiently add as.success() call or a sub-step with as.success()
        call, if there are other sub-steps added
    * run-time should optimize the sub-step case
1. *void error( name [, error_info] )*
    * complete with error
    * throws FutoIn.Error exception
    * calls onerror( async_iface, name ) after returning to execution engine
    * *error_info* - assigned to "error_info" state field
1. *void setTimeout( timeout_ms )*
    * inform execution engine to wait for either success() or error()
    for specified timeout in ms. On timeout, error("Timeout") is called
1. *call operator overloading*
    * if supported by language/platform, alias for success()
1. *void setCancel( cancel_callback oncancel )*
    * set callback, to be used to cancel execution
1. *void waitExternal()*
    * prevent implicit as.success() behavior of current step

### 2.2.3. Control API - can be used only on Root AsyncSteps object

1. *execute()* - must be called only once after root object steps are configured.
    * Initiates AsyncSteps execution implementation-defined way
1. *cancel()* - may be called on root object to asynchronously cancel execution

### 2.2.4. Execution Loop API - can be used only inside execute_callback

1. *void loop( func, [, label] )*
    * execute loop until *as.break()* is called
    * *func( as )* - loop body
    * *label* - optional label to use for *as.break()* and *as.continue()* in inner loops
1. *void forEach( map|list, func [, label] )*
    * for each *map* or *list* element call *func( as, key, value )*
    * *func( as, key, value )* - loop body
    * *label* - optional label to use for *as.break()* and *as.continue()* in inner loops
1. *void repeat( count, func [, label] )*
    * Call *func(as, i)* for *count* times
    * *count* - how many times to call the *func*
    * *func( as, i )* - loop body, i - current iteration starting from 0
    * *label* - optional label to use for *as.break()* and *as.continue()* in inner loops
1. *void break( [label] )*
    * break execution of current loop, throws exception
    * *label* - unwind loops, until *label* named loop is exited
1. *void continue( [label] )*
    * continue loop execution from the next iteration, throws exception
    * *label* - break loops, until *label* named loop is found

### 2.3. `Mutex` class

* Must implemenet ISync interface
* Functions:
    * *c-tor(unsigned integer max=1, unsigned integer max_queue=null)*
        * set maximum number of parallel AsyncSteps entering critical section
        * *max_queue* - optionally, limit queue length

### 2.4. `Throttle` class

* Must implemenet ISync interface
* Functions:
    * *c-tor(unsigned integer max, unsigned integer period_ms=1000, unsigned integer max_queue=null)*
        * set maximum number of critical section entries within specification time period.
        * *period_ms* - time period in milliseconds
        * *max_queue* - optionally, limit queue length

### 2.5. `Limiter` class

* Must implemenet ISync interface
* Functions:
    * *c-tor(options)*
        * Complex limit handling
        * *options.concurrent=1*  - maximum concurrent flows
        * *options.max_queue=0* - maximum queued
        * *options.rate=1*  - maximum entries in period
        * *options.period_ms=1000*  - period length
        * *options.burst=0*  - maximum queue for rate limiting
